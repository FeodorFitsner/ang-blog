# ang-blog

## Overview

This is a prototype blog implementation in MVC. It allows for parallel view implementations, which is useful for learning and comparison across multiple web client technologies. The view technology of choice can be chosen in the site header at runtime.

Current view implementations include native razor views, and angular. Next up should be reactjs.net.
